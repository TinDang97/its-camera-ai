## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **Database replication lag** - Platform Engineer monitors
2. **Kafka broker failure** - Platform Engineer implements HA
3. **GPU memory leaks** - CV Optimizer implements monitoring
4. **Network policy conflicts** - Security Engineer validates
5. **Secret exposure** - Security Engineer audits

### Contingency Plans
- Rollback procedures for each component
- Backup environments ready
- Manual failover procedures documented
- Emergency contact list maintained

This assignment ensures optimal utilization of each agent team's expertise while maintaining clear ownership and accountability for each infrastructure component.
