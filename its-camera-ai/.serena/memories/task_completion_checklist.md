# ITS Camera AI - Task Completion Checklist

## Before Committing Code

### 1. Code Quality Checks (MANDATORY)
```bash
# Format code (must pass)
make format
# or individually:
black src/ tests/
isort src/ tests/
ruff format src/ tests/

# Lint code (must pass)
make lint
# or:
ruff check src/ tests/

# Type checking (must pass)
make type-check
# or:
mypy src/

# Security checks (must pass)
make security-check
# or individually:
bandit -r src/
safety check
pip-audit

# Run all quality checks
make code-quality
```

### 2. Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)
```bash
# Run all tests with minimum 90% coverage (ENFORCED)
pytest --cov=src/its_camera_ai --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=90

# Or use make command
make test

# For specific components, ensure relevant tests pass:
make test-ml          # If ML components changed
make test-gpu         # If GPU code changed  
make test-integration # If service interactions changed
```

### 3. Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Run pre-commit hooks (recommended)
make pre-commit
# or:
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Performance Validation

### 4. ML Model Performance (if ML changes)
- Production models must meet requirements:
  - **Accuracy**: >90% 
  - **Inference latency**: <100ms
  - **Memory usage**: Within GPU memory limits
- Run ML-specific tests: `make test-ml`
- Validate model registry integration
- Check model versioning and deployment stages

### 5. API Performance (if API changes)
- Response times under acceptable limits
- Proper error handling and status codes
- Authentication and authorization working
- API documentation updated automatically

### 6. Security Validation (if security components changed)
- All sensitive data properly encrypted
- Authentication flows working correctly
- RBAC permissions properly enforced
- Security audit logging operational
- Privacy controls functioning

## Documentation Updates

### 7. Code Documentation
- All public functions have proper docstrings
- Type hints present for all function parameters and returns
- Complex logic has inline comments
- API endpoints have proper FastAPI documentation

### 8. Configuration Updates
- Environment variables documented if new ones added
- Docker configuration updated if dependencies changed
- Kubernetes manifests updated if deployment changed

## Integration Testing

### 9. Service Integration
- All service dependencies properly mocked in tests
- Integration tests pass for modified components
- Database migrations work correctly
- Message queue integration functional

### 10. Performance Testing
```bash
# Run benchmarks if performance-critical code changed
make benchmark

# Profile code if significant changes
make profile
```

## Deployment Readiness

### 11. Environment Compatibility
- Code works in development environment: `make dev`
- Docker images build successfully: `make docker-build`
- Production configuration valid

### 12. Monitoring & Observability
- Proper logging implemented for new features
- Metrics exposed for monitoring
- Health checks updated if new services added
- Alerting configured for critical paths

## Final Checks

### 13. Dependencies
- All new dependencies added to pyproject.toml
- Dependency groups properly categorized (dev, ml, gpu, edge)
- Security vulnerabilities checked: `safety check`

### 14. Git Hygiene
- Commit messages descriptive and clear
- No sensitive information in commits
- Proper branch naming conventions followed
- Pull request template completed

## Critical Path Validation

### 15. Camera Processing Pipeline (if modified)
- Stream ingestion working correctly
- Frame processing maintaining target latency
- Object detection accuracy maintained
- Output formatting correct

### 16. Model Deployment Pipeline (if modified)
- Model registry operations functional
- A/B testing framework operational
- Rollback procedures tested
- Federated learning synchronization working

## Post-Commit Verification

### 17. CI/CD Pipeline
- All CI checks passing
- Automated tests running successfully
- Docker image building and pushing
- Deployment pipeline functional

### 18. Production Monitoring
- No new errors in production logs
- Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
- System health indicators green
- User-facing functionality working correctly

## Emergency Procedures

### If Tests Fail
1. Fix failing tests before proceeding
2. Maintain minimum 90% code coverage
3. Do not commit with failing tests

### If Security Checks Fail
1. Address all security vulnerabilities immediately
2. Do not commit code with security issues
3. Escalate critical security findings

### If Performance Degrades
1. Profile and identify performance bottlenecks
2. Optimize before committing
3. Ensure sub-100ms inference latency maintained
4. Validate GPU memory usage within limits

## Success Criteria
✅ All code quality checks pass  
✅ Test coverage ≥90%  
✅ All tests pass  
✅ No security vulnerabilities  
✅ Performance targets met  
✅ Documentation updated  
✅ Integration tests pass  
✅ Production readiness validated
