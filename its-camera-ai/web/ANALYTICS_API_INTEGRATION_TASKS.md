## ðŸ”„ INTEGRATION TASKS

### Task ID: INT-ANA-001
**Title**: End-to-End Integration Testing
**Assignee**: Both Frontend & Backend Developers
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Sprint**: Sprint 3
**Story Points**: 8

#### Description
Conduct comprehensive end-to-end integration testing of the analytics system, including WebSocket connections, data flow, and UI interactions.

#### Technical Requirements
- Set up E2E test environment with Cypress/Playwright
- Create test scenarios for all user workflows
- Implement API contract testing
- Add performance testing under load
- Create data consistency validation
- Implement security testing scenarios
- Add cross-browser testing suite
- Create mobile device testing

#### Test Scenarios
```typescript
// E2E test example
describe('Analytics Dashboard Integration', () => {
  it('should display real-time updates via WebSocket', () => {
    cy.visit('/analytics');
    cy.connectWebSocket();
    cy.mockWebSocketMessage(mockTrafficData);
    cy.get('[data-testid="traffic-count"]')
      .should('contain', mockTrafficData.count);
  });
  
  it('should handle connection failures gracefully', () => {
    cy.visit('/analytics');
    cy.disconnectWebSocket();
    cy.get('[data-testid="connection-status"]')
      .should('contain', 'Reconnecting...');
  });
});
```

#### Acceptance Criteria
â–¡ All user workflows tested E2E
â–¡ WebSocket reliability >99.9%
â–¡ API contracts validated
â–¡ Performance meets SLA under load
â–¡ Data consistency maintained
â–¡ Security vulnerabilities addressed
â–¡ Cross-browser tests passing
â–¡ Mobile experience validated

#### Dependencies
