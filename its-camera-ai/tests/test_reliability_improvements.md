# Test Reliability Improvements and Performance Coverage

## Overview

This document summarizes the P2 test reliability issues that have been fixed and the comprehensive performance test coverage that has been added to the ITS Camera AI system.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Generic Exception Assertions (B017)

**Problem**: Tests were using blind `Exception` assertions with `pytest.raises(Exception)`
**Files Affected**: `tests/test_service_mesh_integration.py`
**Lines Fixed**: 116, 121, 145

**Solution**: 
- Replaced generic `Exception` with specific exception types (`RuntimeError`, `CircuitBreakerError`)
- Added new exception types to core exceptions module:
  - `ServiceMeshError`: Base exception for service mesh operations
  - `CircuitBreakerError`: Specific exception for circuit breaker failures

**Example Fix**:
```python
# Before (problematic)
with pytest.raises(Exception):
    await breaker.call(failing_func)

# After (fixed)
with pytest.raises(RuntimeError):
    await breaker.call(failing_func)
```

### 2. Silent Exception Handling (S110, SIM105)

**Problem**: `try/except/pass` blocks without proper logging or error handling
**File**: `tests/test_service_mesh_integration.py:654-661`

**Solution**: 
- Replaced `try/except/pass` with `contextlib.suppress()` for cleaner code
- Added proper imports for `contextlib`

**Example Fix**:
```python
# Before (problematic)
try:
    await mesh_client.call_service("failing_service", "test_method", {"test": "data"})
except (ServiceMeshError, Exception):
    pass  # Expected failures

# After (fixed)
with contextlib.suppress(ServiceMeshError, RuntimeError):
    await mesh_client.call_service("failing_service", "test_method", {"test": "data"})
```

### 3. Nested Context Managers (SIM117)

**Problem**: Multiple nested `with` statements that could be combined
**File**: `tests/test_auth_service.py` (multiple instances)

**Solution**: 
- Combined nested `with` statements using Python 3.10+ parenthesized context managers syntax
- Improved code readability and reduced nesting levels

**Example Fix**:
```python
# Before (problematic)
with patch.object(service, "method1"):
    with patch.object(service, "method2"):
        with patch.object(service, "method3"):
            # test code

# After (fixed)
with (
    patch.object(service, "method1"),
    patch.object(service, "method2"),
    patch.object(service, "method3"),
):
    # test code
```

### 4. Syntax Errors

**Problem**: Indentation and syntax issues in auth service tests
**File**: `tests/test_auth_service.py:442, 804`

**Solution**: 
- Fixed incorrect indentation in assertion statements
- Corrected malformed test class definitions

## Test Execution

### Running Reliability Tests
```bash
# Run all performance tests
pytest tests/test_performance_benchmarks.py -v -m performance

# Run specific benchmark tests
pytest tests/test_performance_benchmarks.py -v -m benchmark

# Run memory profiling tests
pytest tests/test_streaming_service.py -v -m performance

# Run load tests
pytest tests/test_performance_benchmarks.py -v -m load
```

### Test Coverage Verification
