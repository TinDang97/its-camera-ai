### Accessibility-First Components

```tsx
// ✅ DO: Build with accessibility in mind
function Button({ children, onClick, variant = 'primary', ...props }) {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={onClick}
      className={cn(
        'px-4 py-2 rounded-lg font-medium transition-all',
        'focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2',
        'disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed',
        variants[variant]
      )}
      aria-label={props['aria-label'] || children}
      {...props}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Micro-interactions & Animations

```tsx
// Using Framer Motion for delightful interactions
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion';

function Card({ children, isHovered }) {
  return (
    <motion.div
      layout
      initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
      exit={{ opacity: 0, y: -20 }}
      whileHover={{ scale: 1.02, boxShadow: '0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)' }}
      transition={{ type: 'spring', stiffness: 300 }}
      className="p-6 bg-white rounded-xl"
    >
      {children}
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```

## UI Library Recommendations

### Primary: shadcn/ui + Radix UI

```bash
# Installation
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button dialog form toast
```

```tsx
// Modern, accessible components
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';
import { Dialog, DialogContent, DialogTrigger } from '@/components/ui/dialog';
import { useToast } from '@/components/ui/use-toast';

function FeatureComponent() {
  const { toast } = useToast();
  
  return (
    <Dialog>
      <DialogTrigger asChild>
        <Button variant="outline" size="lg">
          Open Feature
        </Button>
      </DialogTrigger>
      <DialogContent className="sm:max-w-[425px]">
        {/* Content */}
      </DialogContent>
    </Dialog>
  );
}
```

### Animation: Framer Motion

```tsx
// Advanced animations and gestures
import { motion, useScroll, useTransform } from 'framer-motion';

function ParallaxHero() {
  const { scrollY } = useScroll();
  const y = useTransform(scrollY, [0, 300], [0, -150]);
  
  return (
    <motion.div style={{ y }} className="hero-content">
      {/* Parallax content */}
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```

### Icons: Lucide React

```tsx
import { Search, Settings, User } from 'lucide-react';

// Consistent, customizable icons
<Search className="h-5 w-5 text-gray-500" />
```

### Charts: Recharts / Tremor

```tsx
import { AreaChart, Card, Title } from '@tremor/react';

function Analytics({ data }) {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Title>Performance Metrics</Title>
      <AreaChart
        data={data}
        index="date"
        categories={['views', 'clicks']}
        colors={['blue', 'green']}
      />
    </Card>
  );
}
```

## UX Best Practices

### Loading States

```tsx
// ✅ DO: Implement skeleton screens
function ProductSkeleton() {
  return (
    <div className="animate-pulse">
      <div className="h-48 bg-gray-200 rounded-lg mb-4" />
      <div className="h-4 bg-gray-200 rounded w-3/4 mb-2" />
      <div className="h-4 bg-gray-200 rounded w-1/2" />
    </div>
  );
}

// ✅ DO: Use progressive enhancement
function ImageWithFallback({ src, alt, ...props }) {
  const [error, setError] = useState(false);
  
  if (error) {
    return <div className="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center">
      <ImageIcon className="text-gray-400" />
    </div>;
  }
  
  return (
    <Image
      src={src}
      alt={alt}
      onError={() => setError(true)}
      placeholder="blur"
      {...props}
    />
  );
}
```

### Error Handling

```tsx
// ✅ DO: Graceful error states
function ErrorBoundary({ error, reset }) {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-[400px] flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
      <AlertCircle className="h-12 w-12 text-red-500 mb-4" />
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Something went wrong</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">{error.message}</p>
      <Button onClick={reset} variant="outline">
        Try again
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Performance Patterns

```tsx
// ✅ DO: Virtualize long lists
import { useVirtualizer } from '@tanstack/react-virtual';

function VirtualList({ items }) {
  const virtualizer = useVirtualizer({
    count: items.length,
    getScrollElement: () => parentRef.current,
    estimateSize: () => 100,
  });
  
  return (
    <div ref={parentRef} className="h-[600px] overflow-auto">
      <div style={{ height: `${virtualizer.getTotalSize()}px` }}>
        {virtualizer.getVirtualItems().map(virtualItem => (
          <div
            key={virtualItem.key}
            style={{
              position: 'absolute',
              top: 0,
              left: 0,
              width: '100%',
              transform: `translateY(${virtualItem.start}px)`,
            }}
          >
            {items[virtualItem.index]}
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
