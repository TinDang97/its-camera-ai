# Architectural Patterns and Design Decisions

## Overview

This document explains the key architectural patterns, design decisions, and trade-offs made in the ITS Camera AI system. It provides context for understanding the sequence diagrams and C4 model diagrams.

## Core Architectural Patterns

### 1. Event-Driven Microservices Architecture

**Pattern**: Services communicate through events rather than direct calls
**Implementation**: Redis queues, Apache Kafka, gRPC streaming
**Benefits**: 
- Loose coupling between services
- Better scalability and resilience
- Easier to add new services
- Natural fit for real-time processing

**Example**: Camera streams trigger events that flow through the processing pipeline without tight coupling between components.

### 2. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

**Pattern**: Separate read and write operations with different data models
**Implementation**: 
- Write operations go to PostgreSQL
- Read operations optimized with Redis caching
- Analytics queries use TimescaleDB
**Benefits**:
- Optimized read performance
- Scalable write operations
- Better data consistency

### 3. Circuit Breaker Pattern

**Pattern**: Prevent cascade failures by failing fast when services are down
**Implementation**: Built into service-to-service communication
**Benefits**:
- System resilience
- Graceful degradation
- Faster error detection

### 4. Bulkhead Pattern

**Pattern**: Isolate critical resources to prevent resource starvation
**Implementation**: 
- Separate GPU memory pools for different workloads
- Dedicated thread pools for different operations
- Resource quotas in Kubernetes
**Benefits**:
- Fault isolation
- Performance predictability
- Resource guarantee for critical operations

## Design Decisions and Trade-offs

### 1. GPU Batch Processing Strategy

**Decision**: Use adaptive batching instead of fixed batch sizes
**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Optimal GPU utilization
- ✅ Lower latency under varying loads
- ❌ More complex implementation
- ❌ Memory management complexity

**Implementation**: `AdaptiveBatcher` monitors queue length and GPU utilization to determine optimal batch sizes dynamically.

### 2. Multi-Tier Caching Strategy

**Decision**: Implement L1 (in-memory) + L2 (Redis) + L3 (database) caching
**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Excellent read performance
- ✅ Reduced database load
- ❌ Cache invalidation complexity
- ❌ Memory overhead

**Cache TTL Strategy**:
- L1: 5 seconds (frequently accessed data)
- L2: 5 minutes (session and temporary data)
- L3: 1 hour (configuration and metadata)

### 3. Hybrid Edge-Cloud Deployment

**Decision**: Support both edge and cloud deployment with federated learning
**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Reduced latency for critical operations
- ✅ Data privacy compliance
- ✅ Offline operation capability
- ❌ Complexity in model synchronization
- ❌ Edge resource constraints

**Implementation**: Models deployed to edge with periodic updates from cloud-trained global models.

### 4. gRPC for Inter-Service Communication

**Decision**: Use gRPC for high-throughput internal communication
**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ High performance with Protocol Buffers
- ✅ Strong typing and code generation
- ✅ Built-in streaming support
- ❌ Less human-readable than REST
- ❌ Requires specialized tooling

**Usage Pattern**: gRPC for internal services, REST for external APIs.

### 5. PostgreSQL as Primary Database

**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL instead of NoSQL solutions
**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ ACID compliance for critical data
- ✅ Rich querying capabilities
- ✅ Excellent JSON support
- ✅ Strong consistency
- ❌ Vertical scaling limitations
- ❌ More complex sharding

**Mitigation**: Use read replicas and time-based partitioning for scalability.

## Performance Design Patterns

### 1. Memory Pool Pattern

**Purpose**: Efficient GPU memory management
**Implementation**: Pre-allocated memory pools for different tensor sizes
**Benefits**: 
- Reduced memory allocation overhead
- Predictable memory usage
- Faster inference execution

```python
class MemoryPoolManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pools = {
            'small': GPUMemoryPool(size_mb=256),
            'medium': GPUMemoryPool(size_mb=512),
            'large': GPUMemoryPool(size_mb=1024)
        }
    
    def get_memory(self, size_category):
        return self.pools[size_category].allocate()
```

### 2. Async Processing Pipeline

**Purpose**: Non-blocking operations throughout the system
**Implementation**: Python asyncio with proper resource management
**Benefits**:
- Higher throughput
- Better resource utilization
- Improved user experience

**Pattern**:
```python
async def process_camera_stream(camera_id: str):
    async with get_db_session() as db:
        async with get_redis_client() as redis:
            # Process frames asynchronously
            async for frame in stream_processor.get_frames(camera_id):
                await vision_engine.process_frame(frame)
```

### 3. Result Streaming Pattern

**Purpose**: Real-time result delivery without buffering
**Implementation**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for browser clients, gRPC streaming for services
**Benefits**:
- Real-time updates
- Lower memory usage
- Better user experience

## Security Design Patterns

### 1. Defense in Depth

**Implementation**:
- Network security (firewalls, VPNs)
- Application security (input validation, authentication)
- Data security (encryption at rest and in transit)
- Container security (Pod security policies, secrets management)

### 2. Zero Trust Architecture

**Principles**:
- Never trust, always verify
- Least privilege access
- Assume breach mindset
- Continuous monitoring

**Implementation**:
- mTLS for service-to-service communication
- JWT with short expiration times
- Regular security audits
- Real-time threat detection

### 3. Privacy by Design

**Implementation**:
- Data minimization (collect only necessary data)
- Purpose limitation (use data only for stated purposes)
- Transparency (clear privacy policies)
- Data subject rights (export, deletion capabilities)

## Scalability Patterns

### 1. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) Pattern

**Trigger Conditions**:
- CPU utilization > 70%
- Memory utilization > 80%
- Custom metrics (queue length, GPU utilization)

**Implementation**:
```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
spec:
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
```

### 2. Database Sharding Pattern

**Strategy**: Time-based partitioning for historical data
**Implementation**:
- Partition by camera_id and timestamp
- Use PostgreSQL native partitioning
- Automatic partition creation and dropping

### 3. Read Replica Pattern

**Purpose**: Distribute read load across multiple database instances
**Implementation**:
- Master-slave replication with PostgreSQL
- Application-level read/write splitting
- Automatic failover for high availability

## Anti-Patterns Avoided

### 1. Distributed Monolith

**Problem**: Microservices that are too tightly coupled
**Solution**: Clear service boundaries with event-driven communication

### 2. Chatty Interfaces

**Problem**: Too many small service calls causing network overhead
**Solution**: Batch operations and intelligent caching

### 3. Database Per Service Taken Too Far

**Problem**: Data consistency issues with too many databases
**Solution**: Shared database for related data with clear ownership

### 4. Premature Optimization

**Problem**: Optimizing before understanding bottlenecks
**Solution**: Measure first, then optimize based on actual performance data

## Monitoring and Observability Patterns

### 1. Three Pillars of Observability

**Metrics**: Quantitative measurements (response time, throughput, error rate)
**Logs**: Event records with context and correlation IDs
**Traces**: Request flow through distributed system

### 2. Health Check Pattern

**Implementation**:
- Liveness probes (is the service running?)
- Readiness probes (can the service handle requests?)
- Startup probes (has the service fully initialized?)

### 3. Circuit Breaker with Metrics

**Pattern**: Combine circuit breaker with metrics collection
**Benefits**: 
- Understand failure patterns
- Tune circuit breaker parameters
- Alert on circuit breaker trips

## Future Evolution Patterns

### 1. Strangler Fig Pattern

**Purpose**: Gradually replace legacy components
**Implementation**: Route traffic between old and new implementations
**Benefits**: Risk-free migration path

### 2. Blue-Green Deployment

**Purpose**: Zero-downtime deployments
**Implementation**: Maintain two identical production environments
**Benefits**: Instant rollback capability

### 3. Canary Releases

**Purpose**: Gradual feature rollout with risk mitigation
**Implementation**: Route small percentage of traffic to new version
**Benefits**: Early detection of issues with minimal impact
