## Rendering PlantUML Diagrams

To render the PlantUML diagrams, you can use:

### Online Rendering
- [PlantUML Online Server](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/)
- Copy and paste diagram content to render

### Local Rendering
```bash
# Install PlantUML
npm install -g node-plantuml

# Render a single diagram
puml generate diagrams/sequence/camera-stream-processing.puml

# Render all diagrams
find docs/diagrams -name "*.puml" -exec puml generate {} \;
```

### VS Code Extension
- Install "PlantUML" extension by jebbs
- Open `.puml` files and use `Alt+D` to preview

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Key architectural decisions are documented within the HLD document, including:

- Event-driven microservices architecture choice
- GPU optimization strategy with TensorRT
- Zero-trust security implementation
